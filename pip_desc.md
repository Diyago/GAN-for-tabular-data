# GANs for tabular  data
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Diyago/GAN-for-tabular-data/e5a4d437655261755de962b9779c73203611d921/images/logo%20tabular%20gan.svg" height="15%" width="15%">
We well know GANs for success in the realistic image generation. However, they can be applied in tabular data generation. We will review and examine some recent papers about tabular GANs in action.

**Library goal**

Let say we have **T_train** and **T_test** (train and test set respectively). 
We need to train the model on **T_train** and make predictions on **T_test**. 
However, we will increase the train by generating new data by GAN or by sampling
train, somehow similar to **T_test**, without using ground truth labels.
