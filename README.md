# GANs for tabular  data
<img src="./images/tabular_gan.png" height="15%" width="15%">
We well know GANs for success in the realistic image generation. However, they can be applied in tabular data generation. We will review and examine some recent papers about tabular GANs in action.

* Arxiv article: ["Tabular GANs for uneven distribution"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00638)
* Medium post: [GANs for tabular data](https://towardsdatascience.com/review-of-gans-for-tabular-data-a30a2199342)
## Datasets and expriment design

**Running experiment**
To run experiment follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository. All required dataset are stored in `./data` folder
2. Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run all experiments  `python run_experiment.py`. Run all experiments  `python run_experiment.py`. You may add more datasets, adjust validation type and categorical encoders.
5. Observe metrics across all experiment in console or in `./results/fit_predict_scores.txt`

**Task formalization**

Let say we have **T_train** and **T_test** (train and test set respectively). We need to train the model on **T_train** and make predictions on **T_test**. However, we will increase the train by generating new data by GAN, somehow similar to **T_test**, without using ground truth labels.

**Experiment design**

Let say we have **T_train** and **T_test** (train and test set respectively). The size of **T_train** is smaller and might have different data distribution. First of all, we train CTGAN on **T_train** with ground truth labels (step 1), then generate additional data **T_synth** (step 2). Secondly, we train boosting in an adversarial way on concatenated **T_train** and **T_synth** (target set to 0) with **T_test** (target set to 1) (steps 3 & 4). The goal is to apply newly trained adversarial boosting to obtain rows more like **T_test**. Note - initial ground truth labels aren't used for adversarial training. As a result, we take top rows from **T_train** and **T_synth** sorted by correspondence to **T_test** (steps 5 & 6), and train new boosting on them and check results on **T_test**.

**Picture 1.1** Experiment design and workflow

Of course for the benchmark purposes we will test ordinal training without these tricks and another original pipeline but without CTGAN (in step 3 we won't use **T_sync**).

**Datasets**

All datasets came from different domains. They have a different number of observations, number of categorical and numerical features.
The objective for all datasets - binary classification.
Preprocessing of datasets were simple: removed all time-based columns from datasets.
Remaining columns were either categorical or numerical.

## Results

To determine the best sampling strategy, ROC AUC scores of each dataset were scaled (min-max scale) and then averaged among the dataset.

**Table 1.2** Different sampling results across the dataset, higher is better (100% - maximum per dataset ROC AUC)

| dataset_name  |   None |   gan |   sample_original |
|:-----------------------|-------------------:|------------------:|------------------------------:|
| credit                 |           0.997 |          **0.998** |                      0.997 |
| employee               |           **0.986** |          0.966 |                      0.972 |
| mortgages              |           0.984 |          0.964 |                      **0.988** |
| poverty_A              |           0.937 |          **0.950** |                      0.933 |
| taxi                   |           0.966 |          0.938 |                      **0.987** |
| adult                  |           0.995 |          0.967 |                      **0.998** |
| telecom                |           **0.995** |          0.868 |                      0.992 |

**Table 1.3** Different sampling results, higher is better for a mean (ROC AUC), lower is better for std (100% - maximum per dataset ROC AUC)

| sample_type     |     mean |       std |
|:----------------|---------:|----------:|
| None            | 0.980 | 0.036 |
| gan             | 0.969 | 0.06 |
| sample_original | **0.981** | **0.032** |

**Table 1.4** same_target_prop is equal 1 then the target rate for train and test are different no more than 5%. Higher is better.

| sample_type     |   same_target_prop |   prop_test_score |
|:----------------|-------------------:|------------------:|
| None            |                  0 |          0.964 |
| None            |                  1 |          0.985 |
| gan             |                  0 |          0.966 |
| gan             |                  1 |          0.945 |
| sample_original |                  0 |          0.973 |
| sample_original |                  1 |          0.984 |
